  - ![Levels that were passed 2](images/training_levels_2.png)
  - ![Levels that were passed 3](images/training_levels_3.png)
 
### Task 2:

A basic calculator was created with the main functions (+, -, /, *) and a custom task according to the variant. A function for length conversion (meter, centimeter, millimeter) and cube volume calculation was also implemented.

- All project branches:
